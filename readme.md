Overview of the analysis of the Vine program

We performed an analysis of Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive 
reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 
We set out to pick a dataset and determine whether there is an appreciable difference between paid and unpaid reviews.

The purpose of this analysis

The existence of paid reviews raises the question of whether this amounts to buying positive reviews. We set out to answer
the question if paid reviews are signifigantly higher than unpaid reviews.

51.06 percent of Vine reviews were 5 stars

The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement

Although there is a comparatively low number of Vine reviews compared to non-vine which may skew 
the data, the data suggests a bias. It makes intuitive sense. Apart from feeling obligated to give
a positive review after being paid, the data may be skewed for not having the reviews, "It was great but
not a good value for the money." Being paid for the review, that criticism wouldn't be top of mind
for the reviewer. 

An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement 

It may be a good idea to analyze the less than 5 star reviews. What were the criticisms? Perhaps it
was as suggested above, the "Good but not a good value for the money" were greatly reduced among
the paid reviews. It would also be interesting to compare the level of review on behalf of the individual
reviewers and see if a person who consistently gives high or low reviews would deviate signifigantly on 
a paid review. Perhaps this would be the most compelling analysis for whether a bias exists.
